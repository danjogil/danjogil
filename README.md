### Hey there 👋

I'm Daniel, a web developer based in Estonia.
  </br>
  </br>
  Coding nice UIs and problem solving is what I love. I started self learning in early 2023 and it now has become one of the things I enjoy doing the most!
   </br>
  I mostly do frontend work, but in the future I wish to explore everything from design to backend.</br>
  </br>
  Learning is fun, so might as well do it as much as possible!
  </br>
